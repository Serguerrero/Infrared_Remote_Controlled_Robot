Hello, 

This was a project worked on and finished by myslef while completed the Embedded Systems 1 course at UTA conducted by Professor Jason Losh. This project consist of building a small robot with two motors on the rear to controller the direction of the robot. Using a LG tv remote controller and a IR sensor on the robot, based on the binary signal captured by the sensor, it will determine which button was pressed and process each press of a button. User were to first tap on the numeral button to enter desired distance to travel in cm, ie. Press 1 followed by 0 for 10cm. Secondly user was to tap on either up, down, right, or left on the remote to enter the desired direction to move. Lastly, the OK button would be pressed to pass all inputs to the micro controller and send corresponding PWM to each motor. 

  This project used the TI TM4C123G micro-controller.
  Each wheel connected to the motor had a small magnet, this would trigger a fixed hall sensor near each wheel to allow to count revolutions of the wheels and determine how far each wheel had traveled. 

More information can be found in the project report

Thanks!
